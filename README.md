# Multimodal Data Fusion and Target Detection for High-Frequency Financial Trading

Welcome to the official repository for research on **Multimodal Data Fusion and Target Detection Algorithm for High-Frequency Financial Trading**. This project introduces a robust framework combining advanced algorithmic strategies to enhance trading performance in dynamic financial markets.

## Abstract
High-frequency financial trading requires handling intricate dynamics and fusing multimodal data for accurate target detection and decision-making. This repository implements the proposed **Dynamic Financial Interaction Network (DFIN)** and **Adaptive Risk-Informed Optimization (ARIO)** strategies. DFIN models sequential dependencies and multivariate interactions using temporal encoders and graph neural networks, while ARIO incorporates dynamic recalibration and event-aware mechanisms for optimized performance under volatile market conditions. The methodology is enhanced with risk-constrained decision-making and scenario-based simulation to improve robustness.

Key features:
- Multimodal data fusion for non-stationary and high-dimensional financial datasets.
- Adaptive optimization strategies tailored for dynamic market conditions.
- State-of-the-art performance in prediction accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability.
